This software implements the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) in pytorch.
Origin software could be found in [crnn](https://github.com/bgshih/crnn)

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dboqjk20qjkpta3/crnn.pth?dl=0). 
This pretrained model is converted from auther offered one by ``tool``.
Put the downloaded model file ``crnn.pth`` into directory ``data/``. Then launch the demo by:

    python demo.py

The demo reads an example image and recognizes its text content.

Example image:
![Example Image](./data/demo.png)

Expected output:
    loading pretrained model from ./data/crnn.pth
    a-----v--a-i-l-a-bb-l-ee-- => available
